                        Allow your pedigree to be revealed:<br/>
                        The mighty potter threw you on his wheel<br/> 
                        (<em>squinting at the snout</em>) </br/>

                        Your watchful eye cannot be banned From rooms with bodies banging.</br> 
                        You light up our thighs in bloom You singe hairs from our flow'ring hoo-hahs.<a class="fn" href="#note-4">4</a></p>

                        <p>(<em>fondly</em>) And you do all that without blabbing to the neighbors.</p> 

                        <p class="dir">She puts down the wreath and walking stick as she cradles the lamp in her other hand.</p>

                    <h3>Notes</h3>
                    <div class="note" id="note-3">3<p>In the Greek, the lines that follow employ tragic diction and meter (Sommerstein 1), but 
                    are meant to parody tragic apostrophe by addressing mundane subject matter (Ussher 70). 
                    We have used quasi-Shakespearean diction to capture the somber form of the speech.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="note" id="note-4">4 <p>Ancient Greek women used lamp flames to remove hair from what we would now call 
                    the bikini line.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="note" id="note-5">5 <p>The Scira festival was held every June in honor of the goddess Demeter. Because only 
                    women were allowed to attend, it would have been a perfect place to begin a female 
                    conspiracy. In <em>Thesmophoriazousai </em>(another Aristophanes play) the women conspire at a 
                    different festival to Demeter called the Thesmophoria.</p>

                    <div class="note" id="note-6">6 <p>Fur-OH-mack-us. Nothing else is known about Phyromachus. Sommerstein (4) suggests 
                    that the following joke puns off of the dual meaning of &quot;seat&quot; as both &quot;place to sit&quot; and 
                    &quot;rump&quot;.</p>
